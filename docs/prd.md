# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## MCP Server for GCP and Kubernetes Incident Response

### 1. Introduction and Background

This document outlines the requirements for an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation that will help non-operations developers and time-constrained operations personnel quickly respond to incidents in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Kubernetes environments. The solution leverages the MCP-Go library to create a server that can be used with any AI chat interface supporting MCP, such as Cursor.

### 2. Goals and Objectives

**Primary Goal**: Enable users to efficiently diagnose and respond to cloud infrastructure issues without deep operational expertise or significant time investment.

**Key Objectives**:

- Provide quick access to relevant diagnostic information from GCP and Kubernetes
- Offer contextual guidance based on documentation and best practices
- Suggest remediation steps with clear explanations
- Reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR) for common cloud incidents
- Enable future capabilities for automated remediation actions

### 3. Target Users

- **Primary**: Non-operations developers who need to troubleshoot cloud infrastructure issues
- **Secondary**: Operations personnel with limited time who need quick issue resolution
- **Tertiary**: Organizations with limited cloud operations expertise seeking to improve incident response

### 4. System Architecture

The system will be implemented as an MCP server using the mark3labs/mcp-go library, consisting of:

- **Core MCP Server**: Implements the MCP protocol for AI chat interface integration
- **Authentication Layer**: Handles OAuth authentication with GCP
- **Resource Access Layer**: Provides access to GCP and Kubernetes resources
- **Tools Layer**: Implements diagnostic and remediation capabilities
- **Documentation Integration**: Accesses relevant documentation and best practices

### 5. Features and Capabilities

#### Phase 1: Diagnostic Capabilities

- **Issue Retrieval**: Fetch active issues from GCP logging and monitoring
- **Log Analysis**: Retrieve and analyze logs for specific services/components
- **Resource Monitoring**: Check resource utilization and constraints
- **Configuration Analysis**: Examine configurations for misconfigurations
- **Documentation Access**: Reference relevant documentation for context
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify potential root causes based on diagnostic data
- **Remediation Guidance**: Suggest commands and actions for issue resolution

The system should be capable of diagnosing a broad range of issues, including:

- Pod crashes/restarts
- Resource constraints (CPU/memory)
- Network connectivity issues
- Service disruptions
- Configuration problems
- Deployment failures
- Autoscaling issues
- API rate limiting

#### Phase 2: Remediation Capabilities (Future)

- **Automated Actions**: Execute approved remediation steps
- **Verification**: Confirm successful resolution
- **Rollback**: Safely revert changes if needed

### 6. Authentication and Security

- **Authentication Method**: OAuth on behalf of the user
- **Permission Model**:
  - Initial access limited to read-only operations (Phase 1)
  - Progressive permission escalation with user approval for remediation actions (Phase 2)
- **Security Controls**:
  - Clear disclosure of requested permissions
  - Audit logging of all actions
  - User confirmation for potentially impactful operations
  - Safeguards against unintended changes to production environments

### 7. User Experience Flow

1. **Issue Identification**:
   - User connects to the MCP server via a compatible AI chat interface
   - User requests information about active issues or describes a specific problem

2. **Diagnostic Process**:
   - System authenticates with GCP using OAuth
   - System queries relevant GCP services to gather diagnostic information
   - System analyzes the data to identify potential causes

3. **Response Presentation**:
   - System presents findings with appropriate technical detail
   - System references relevant documentation
   - System suggests potential remediation steps

4. **Remediation Guidance**:
   - System provides specific commands or actions to resolve the issue
   - System explains the rationale for the suggested remediation

### 8. Integration Points

The system will integrate with the following GCP and Kubernetes components:

- **Cloud Logging**: For log retrieval and analysis
- **Cloud Monitoring/Error Reporting**: For metrics and alerts
- **GKE APIs**: For Kubernetes cluster information
- **Cloud Trace**: For distributed tracing data
- **Kubernetes API server**: For cluster state information
- **Stackdriver alerts**: For active alert information
- **Cloud Pub/Sub**: For notification streams (optional)
- **Security Command Center**: For security-related issues (optional)

### 9. Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1 (Initial Release)

- MCP server implementation with OAuth authentication
- Read-only diagnostic capabilities
- Documentation integration
- Remediation guidance

#### Phase 2 (Future Enhancement)

### 10. Success Metrics

- Reduction in mean time to resolution (MTTR) for incidents
- Percentage of issues successfully diagnosed
- User satisfaction ratings
- Documentation coverage for common issues
- Adoption rate among target users

### 11. Technical Requirements

- Implementation using mark3labs/mcp-go library
- Secure handling of authentication credentials
- Efficient resource usage to maintain performance
